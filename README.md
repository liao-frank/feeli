## Inspiration
The majority of communications done today are over the Internet. A lot of times, personal meta-qualities are lost over text-based communications :( Sometimes the result is confusing intentions and ambiguous feelings. feeli tries to pull emotional and social contexts back out of text-based communications!

## What it does
feeli determines emotional and social qualities of text-based messages through IBM's Watson API.

## How we built it
feeli currently uses Chrome as its platform. The extension is built with standard web tools (HTML, CSS, JS).

## Challenges we faced
API calls through standard non-Node js methods is not fun.

Designing and building the interface from the ground up was a frustrating experience at first.
